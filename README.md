# Anxiety Detection with Machine Learning

## Project Description

**Stress detection is a challenging task**, as there are so many words that can be used by people on their posts that can show whether a person is having psychological stress or not. In this repository, I am attempting to address the intricate task of stress detection in social media posts using the Python programming language.

## Key Features

- Utilizes machine learning techniques, including **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Naive Bayes**, for anxiety detection.
- Analyzes social media posts from platforms like Instagram and Reddit.
- Aims to provide insights into individuals' psychological well-being.

# Churn Prediction System using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
## Project Description and Features

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) to predict customer churn for a business. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses as it helps them identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing for targeted retention strategies.
